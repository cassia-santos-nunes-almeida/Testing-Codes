# EM-AC-STACK-Assessments

## 1. Project Identity

Owner: Cássia Almeida (she/her), Associate Professor, LUT University (Finland)
Languages: English (primary for technical work), Finnish (institutional), Portuguese (personal)
Expertise level: Senior — skip fundamentals unless asked. Precision over completeness.
Role context: Engineering educator building AI-integrated teaching tools, assessment systems, and interactive web applications for electromagnetic theory and circuit analysis students.

Active courses:
* BL30A0350 — Electromagnetism and Circuit Analysis (EM&AC)
* LES10A020 — Engineering Physics (EP, co-taught with Mikko Äijälä and Ayesha Sadiqa)

Reference textbooks:
* Ulaby — Fundamentals of Applied Electromagnetics
* Ida — Engineering Electromagnetics
* Nilsson & Riedel — Electric Circuits

Notation conflict (known): Cross-sectional area: A (Nilsson) vs. S (Ulaby). Flux linkage: λ (Nilsson) vs. Λ (Ulaby). Always use the convention of the course being worked on — ask if unclear.

## 2. Behavior Defaults

* Architecture-first: explain structure before writing code.
* Confirm intent before writing code for any non-trivial task.
* Flag risks, edge cases, and conflicts proactively — do not wait to be asked.
* Only modify explicitly requested parts. Leave everything else untouched.
* When multiple options exist, present them with tradeoffs — let Cássia decide.
* Never add new ideas to messages or documents. Never remove existing ones. Only adjust what is asked.

Tone: Professional, direct, warm, natural. No flattery. No filler.

Environment:
* OS: Windows / PowerShell
* Python: use python — not python3 (not on PATH)
* Claude Code active — use session teleport when needed; re-authenticate with /login if token expired

## 3. Task Decomposition and Execution Strategy

Before starting any non-trivial task, assess scope:

**Step 1 — Size check**
If a task has more than 3 distinct deliverables, affects more than 2 files,
or requires more than one skill — it is too large to execute as one unit.
Decompose it before starting. Never attempt a large task as a single block.

**Step 2 — Dependency map**
For each subtask, determine:
- Does it depend on the output of another subtask? → sequential
- Can it proceed independently? → parallel candidate

**Step 3 — Execution order**
Sequential: use when subtask B needs output from A.
  Example: generate Maxima CAS code → then build XML wrapper around it.
Parallel: use when subtasks share no inputs/outputs.
  Example: draft 3 STACK questions on different topics simultaneously.
Batched parallel: group independent subtasks, execute the batch, then proceed.
  Example: generate all randomization blocks → then all PRT trees → then all XML wrappers.

**Step 4 — Confirm before executing**
Present the subtask list and proposed execution order BEFORE starting work.
Wait for confirmation unless the task is clearly routine.

**Step 5 — Report at each boundary**
At the end of each subtask or batch: report what was completed, what comes
next, and any blocker or decision needed before proceeding.
Do not silently chain subtasks without a checkpoint.

## 4. Self-Verification (applies to all tasks)

Before returning any output:
1. Goal analysis — State the explicit and implicit goals. What does success look like?
2. Assumption audit — List every inference made that was not directly stated in the input. For each: what was the basis, and what would change if the assumption is wrong?
3. Gap identification — What is missing, ambiguous, or likely to fall short?
4. End-to-end self-test — Test output against all stated goals and identified risks. Iterate until requirements are met and output is optimized. Do not return control until this is complete.
5. Pattern check — Before finalizing, check PATTERNS.md. If the output would trigger a known pattern, apply the documented fix automatically.

## 5. Session Protocols

### Session Open
At the start of every session, before any task work:
1. Read CLAUDE.md (this file) — confirm active constraints and project identity.
2. Read PATTERNS.md — load all accumulated corrections and rules. Treat every entry as a hard constraint, not a suggestion.
3. Read SESSION.md if present — resume from last known state.
4. Read `.claude/skill/context_evaluator/context.md` — stable architecture facts.
5. Read `.claude/skill/context_evaluator/personal-preferences.md` — communication and coding style.
6. Confirm readiness: state which skills are relevant to today's work and flag any conflict between loaded files.

Do not begin task work until these steps are confirmed.
To trigger this protocol, say: **open session** or **load context**.

### Session Close
At the end of every session, before returning control:
1. Review the full session for recurring corrections or repeated assumptions — anything said more than once, or any mistake that appeared in more than one place.
2. For each pattern found:
   - Produce a concrete rule in plain language.
   - Add it to PATTERNS.md under the relevant category.
   - State: "Pattern detected: [X]. Rule added: [Y]."
3. Write SESSION.md:
   - What was completed (with file names and locations).
   - What is in progress (enough context to resume cold).
   - Open decisions or blockers.
   - Which PATTERNS.md entries were triggered today.
4. If any SKILL.md should be updated based on today's work, state the proposed change explicitly and ask for confirmation before writing.

To trigger this protocol, say: **close session** or **wrap up**.

## 6. Cross-Skill Rules

These apply to all skills. Skills do not repeat them.

### Writing and communication
* Never use: "flagging", "thanks for flagging" — use "thanks for the heads-up" or "thanks for pointing that out"
* Email sign-off: "Best regards," — never "Best,"
* Sign as: "Cássia" — never full name in sign-off
* Anti-AI banned words: "crucial", "vital", "leverage", "delve", "navigate", "landscape", "groundbreaking", "game-changer", "it's worth noting", "at the end of the day", "in conclusion"

### Code
* Confirm intent before writing non-trivial code
* Explain architectural choices when making decisions that affect structure
* Flag performance and edge cases proactively

### Files and structure
* Check PATTERNS.md before starting any task in a known domain
* Session state lives in SESSION.md — write it at close, read it at open
* Never duplicate content between CLAUDE.md and a SKILL.md — reference by name

## 7. Skill Index

| Skill | Trigger | File |
|-------|---------|------|
| context-evaluator | STACK, Moodle, session management, context loading | .claude/skill/context_evaluator/SKILL.md |
| circuitikz-circuit-diagrams | circuit diagram, draw circuit, CircuiTikZ, LaTeX circuit | .claude/skill/circuitikz-latex-circuit-diagrams/SKILL.md |
| stack-xml-generator | STACK XML authoring, Maxima CAS, PRT validation | .claude/skill/stack-xml-generator/SKILL.md |

Project overview, repository structure, content summaries, and constraints → see `.claude/skill/context_evaluator/context.md`.

## STACK XML Conventions

All generic STACK XML rules (syntax hints, progressive hints, grading/PRT rules, input configuration, Maxima randomization patterns, PRT validation checklist) → see **stack-xml-generator skill** (`.claude/skill/stack-xml-generator/SKILL.md`).

PATTERNS.md entries P-STACK-01 through P-STACK-20 are hard constraints that override any skill defaults.

### EM&AC-Specific: RLC Circuit Formulas

| Circuit | alpha | omega0 | dv/dt(0+) or di/dt(0+) |
|---------|-------|--------|-------------------------|
| Parallel RLC | `1/(2*R*C)` | `1/sqrt(L*C)` | `dv/dt(0+) = -(1/C)*(V0/R + I0)` from KCL |
| Series RLC | `R/(2*L)` | `1/sqrt(L*C)` | `di/dt(0+) = (1/L)*(V0 - R*I0)` |

### Key Patterns

- **Natural response:** No forced term. `v_final = 0` (all exponentials decay to zero).
- **Step response:** Has forced term. `v_final = V_source * (voltage divider)`.
- **Pre-switch DC analysis:** Inductor = short circuit, capacitor = open circuit.
- **Damping classification:**
  - `alpha > omega0` → overdamped (two real roots)
  - `alpha < omega0` → underdamped (complex conjugate roots)
  - `alpha = omega0` → critically damped (repeated root)

## CircuiTikZ / TikZ Circuit Diagrams

All diagram authoring rules, components, compilation pipeline, layout conventions, multi-switch topology patterns, and embedding strategies → see **circuitikz-circuit-diagrams skill** (`.claude/skill/circuitikz-latex-circuit-diagrams/SKILL.md`).

Before creating any diagram, also read:
- `.claude/skill/circuitikz-latex-circuit-diagrams/references/circuit-patterns.md` — 8 standard topology templates
- `shared/templates/circuitikz_template.tex` — starter template

### Task Granularity (STACK Questions + Diagrams)

- **1–2 questions per agent** — never generate a full question set in one task
- **1 diagram per agent** — each `.tex` file is an independent task
- Separate concerns for complex questions: randomization, solution derivation, PRT structure, grading code
- Validate each question independently before bundling
- Maximize parallel agent execution for independent tasks
